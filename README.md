# COMP 3000- Semester Project
## Comparing Sorting Algorithms
### Description
There are many different ways to approach sorting data structures. The goal of this project is to collect data on the efficiency of different sorting algorithms and display them back to the end user.

### Functions
Several functions that will be implemented are functions to:
- Find the execution time of a certain sorting algorithm
- Use a pre-loaded data structure to explore efficiencies
- Enter a custom data structure to test effiencies with
- Test the effiecency of a separate algorithm
- Compile, view, and compare results of different algorithms tested

### Scenario
The user will be presented with an option to use a pre-defined data structure (pre-sorted, reverse sorted, randomly arranged) of differing sizes as well as the ability to enter their own data to be analyzed. The user will then be able to run several different algorithms on the selected data structure. Once finished, the user will have the option to compile a list of the time that each algorithm took, in order to help identify which might work best for their particular implementation. *Memory usage may also be examined to help determine the best algorithm.*
